Group project to create an Intrusion Detection System

IoT Intrusion Detection Competition using Machine Learning Software to detect wireless network intrusions. Software that protects a computer system from various cyber attacks, including perhaps insiders. The task of intrusion detector learning is to build a predictive model (i.e. a machine-learning classifier) capable of distinguishing between “intrusive” traffic, called intrusions or attacks, and “good” normal traffic. Completed by group of 4.
